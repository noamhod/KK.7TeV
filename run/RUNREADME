LOCAL:
	[1] make sure you have either localRunControl.txt OR localRunControl_noSkim.txt (see the "initialize" function)
	[2] see if these files have your desired run properties
	[3] root -b
	[4] .L analysisLocalControlMain.C
	[5] compile("00-00-91","/full/path/to/run"); # OR load("00-00-91","/full/path/to/run");
	[6] alc.initialize();    # alc.initialize(int runNumber = 0, int runs=ALLRUNS, string localRunControlFile = "localRunControl_noSkim.txt");
	[7] if in MC, choose a dataset number
	[8] alc.loop(0,0);       # there are more options to run this function

GDB: same as above but,
	[1] gdb root.exe
	[2] gdb> run
	[3] root [] .L analysisLocalControlMain.C
	[4] root [] compile("00-00-91", "/full/path/to/run", "g");	# to force the use of -g
	[5] break hello.C:3	# to place a breakpoint in hello.C, right after line 2
	[5] rest is same as above
