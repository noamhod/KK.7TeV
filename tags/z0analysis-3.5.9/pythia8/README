to setup the env:
	source setup.sh
	(note that for compilation this is done automatically)

to compile the local MC generation programs:
	[1] source compile.sh Z0
	[2] source compile.sh ZP
	[3] source compile.sh KK

to run the template production:
	root -b plot_ratio_weights.C++
	this will produce a file called weights.root
	with all the templates and the histograms

to read the templates via an example:
	root read_templates_example.C++
	this will display an exampe canvas with the
	imass histograms of the templates

to run the weights analysis:
	[1] root -b -l -q plot_ratio_weights.C++
	this will produce the weights.root file to be used by the Afb analysis
	look in the plots/ directory

to run the Afb fit (after weights.root was created):
	[1] run the previous point
	[2] root -b -l -q compile.C
	look in the fitplots/ directory
